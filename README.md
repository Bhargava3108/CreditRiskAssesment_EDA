## Conclusions
#### Points if a person is likely to default (assessing risk of a borrower):

1.  1.1 Individuals whose income can be verified with income more than 70000, tend to default in the more on their         loans , as they are eligible for higher loan amounts than non-verified individuals and have a higher dept. But individuals in this case tend to create lowest credit loss for a bussiness as their intrest rates are         also higher.


2. 1.1 Individuals who own a house have a defaulter rate of 14.89%, and create higher bad credit or create less profits with recovery.They also have a low recovery rate out of all loans credited.
    
   1.2 Individuals who mention their home ownership as OTHER, have the highest default rate of 18.37% , and they create losses in the overall recovery of the loan. Also have the lowest recovery rate.
   
   1.3 Individuals who RENT or MORTAGAGE the house have high recovery rate , have higher annual income and are profitable in recovery for all loans.


3. Individuals belonging to CA and NY states although with default rate equivalent to other state, create less credit losses to bussiness.
   Individuals belonging to NV state have higher default rates than other states, and also create more credit losses to bussiness.
   Individuals belonging to NE state have the highest default rate, also create high credit losses.
    Individuals belonging to OH,VA, MA, PA with average default rate are overall profitable to bussinesses. 

4. The Default Rate increases as the employment length increases. 
    Individuals with 10+ years of experience are more likely to default ,as they have higher loan eligiblity with average intrest rate but also
     create the least credit losses i.e they are most profitable to bussiness.
    
   4.2 Individuals with 9 years of experience have the lowest intrest rate with lowest default rates but create the most credit loss to the bussiness or are least profitable. But have the highest loan recovery rate.


5. Individuals with 'A' LC-grade have the lowest debt and are less likely to default as they have lowest intrest rates as well , and lowest loan credit.
    But have the lowest recovery rates.

    Individuals with 'B' LC-grade are lower dept rate than average , and also are the most profitable to bussiness , with low credit loss.


6. Loans taken for small bussiness are more likely to create higher credit loss for the bussiness, with the highest default rates.
     They have higher loan amounts with highest intrest rates.
    
    Loans taken for 'debt consolidation' have a average default rate with loan eligiblity of more than average are highly profitable to the bussiness.



7. Individuals with income verified and 10+ yrs experience are more profitable to bussiness despite their higher default rate.
